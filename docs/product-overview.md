# Product Overview — Nexa ERP

Nexa ERP is a modular, auditable platform that runs core back‑office functions. It favours simple British English, guided flows and strong controls so teams can work quickly and safely.

## Vision and scope
- Replace spreadsheets and siloed apps with opinionated processes and approvals.
- Keep data accurate through validation, audit and reconciliations.
- Provide open APIs and logs so every integration is explainable and testable.

## Modules and outcomes
- Finance: reliable ledgers, fast period close, VAT (UK MTD) compliance.
- Sales & CRM: predictable pipeline, faster quote→order→invoice.
- Inventory & WMS: traceable stock moves, high stock accuracy, timely picks/ships.
- Purchasing: budget control, 3‑way match, clean AP ageing.
- Projects: approved time/expenses, accurate billing, revenue recognition.
- HR & Payroll: people data and journals, with proper access boundaries.
- Manufacturing: controlled work orders, cost roll‑ups and variance tracking.

## Policies and approvals
- Segregation of Duties (SoD) on payments, posting, price/discount overrides.
- Amount thresholds and multi‑step approvals; evidence stored next to records.

## Evidence and audit
- Every sensitive action writes an append‑only audit row (who, when, before/after).
- Reports include links back to source documents and retained evidence.
